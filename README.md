# Arduino_based_hydroponic_system
This project was made for my bachelor final project. The intented scope of this project is to build a hydroponic system capable of sustaining itself, by adjusting the nutrient solution properties with the help of the sensors and the diaphragm pumps.

The project can still be improved and some parts of it are written in Romanian language, but it succeeds in demonstrating the principles of a modern hydroponic system.
